# Brand Voice & Design Guidelines: Gigsy

## Core Identity
* **Name:** Gigsy
* **Slogan:** "Tickets without the drama."
* **Mission:** To be the "Safe Harbor" for live event fans—a transparent, stress-free gateway to official tickets.
* **Persona:** The Concierge. Helpful, neutral, transparent, and calm. We are NOT a salesperson.

## The "Safe Harbor" Trust Signals
1.  **Source Transparency:**
    * Every event card MUST clearly display the official Ticket Office logo/name (e.g., Zappa, Barby, Ticketmaster).
    * The user must know *exactly* who is fulfilling the ticket before they click.
2.  **The "No Drama" Copywriting:**
    * **Forbidden:** "Hurry!", "Last Chance!", countdown timers (unless real-time holding), or scarcity tactics.
    * **Required:** Plain, factual language suitable for ages 10-70.
3.  **Fee Transparency (Future State):**
    * We are proud of our 0% fee.
    * **UI Rule:** In the checkout summary, explicitly list "Gigsy Fee: ₪0.00" in green.
    * **External Fees:** Label credit card processing fees clearly as "Bank/Processing Fee," never hide them in the total.

## Visual Guidelines ("Modern Simple")
* **Palette:** High contrast (Slate/Emerald/White). Use white space to reduce cognitive load.
* **Typography:** Legible sans-serif. No text smaller than 16px for core info.
* **Navigation:** Predictable. No "mystery meat" navigation.
* **Device Adaptation (Liquid Layout):**
    * **Mobile:** "Thumb Zone" navigation. Hamburger menu for secondary items.
    * **Desktop:** Sidebar for filters, ample breathing room for content.

## Phase 1 Messaging: "The Honest Beta"
* **Transparency:** Do not pretend we can sell tickets if we can't.
* **The "Coming Soon" Modal:**
    * *Headline:* "Direct Booking is on the way."
    * *Body:* "We're building a 0% fee marketplace. Until then, we'll take you straight to the source."
    * *Tone:* Exciting, not apologetic. We are building something better for them.
